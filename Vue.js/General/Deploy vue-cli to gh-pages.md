GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service designed to host your personal, organization, or project pages directly from a GitHub repository.

Note that GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service and doesnâ€™t support server-side code such as, PHP, Ruby, or Python.

To learn more about the different types of GitHub Pages sites, take a look [here](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/).

Thatâ€™s the theory! Letâ€™s start: ðŸ¤¨

So, you have a github project and you want to host it on netlify. ðŸ˜‚ Iâ€™ am just kidding. You are here because you want to host it on github pages. ðŸ˜‰ Please follow carefully the following steps:



- Create a new local branch in your project and name it `gh-pages`.

- Go to github and copy the name of the repository. Letâ€™s assume the repository name is `my-first-project`

- Create a new file in root directory of your project and name it `vue.config.js`. Learn more about this file [here](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/#global-cli-config).

- In `vue.config.js` file paste the following code:

  ```javascript
  module.exports = {
    publicPath: '/my-first-project/'
  }
  ```

- Run `npm run build`, and wait for it to finish.

- `git add dist -f `

- `git commit dist -m 'gh-pages'`

- Run `git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages`

- Navigate to your github project and click 'Settings'

- Scroll to find the section 'Github Pages' , select the `gh-pages` branch and click 'Save'

- And... that's it!! You site is ready to be published. ðŸŽ†ðŸŽ† ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥.
  You might have to wait a bit. Generally it takes 2â€“10 minutes until this process is done.



# ðŸ˜»ðŸ˜» Pro tip: ðŸ˜»ðŸ˜»

By taking advantage of npm scripts you can deploy your app to gh-pages easily. Please follow the steps below:

- Open `package.json` and add a new script which you can copy/paste below:

  ```json
    "scripts": {
      // ...  
      "deploy-gh-pages": "git checkout -B gh-pages && npm run build && git add dist -f && git commit dist -m 'gh-pages' --no-verify && git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages && git checkout master && git branch -D gh-pages"
    }
  ```

- Open you terminal and run `npm run deploy-gh-pages`
